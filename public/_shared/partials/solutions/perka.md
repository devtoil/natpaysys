##Perka&#8482;

###A little loyalty. A lot of happy.

The PerkaTM solution is one of the easiest ways to market your business. By connecting you to customers through their mobile phones, it helps you draw customers back to your business with special offer and rewards they'll love. Perka makes customers happy, and happy customers keep coming back.

###Benefits for Business

The Perka solution helps you run the same kinds of sophisticated mobile marketing programs as nationwide chains—at a fraction of the cost. And it’s easy to use, as fast as an old-fashioned punchcard and compatible with almost every mobile phone.

###Unique to your business.

Choose the best rewards and loyalty levels for your goals and your customers' tastes. Pick from a points- or punch-based system and how many purchases are needed to earn new rewards.

###Stronger customer relationships.

The Perka app and Beacon help you identify your customers so that you can greet them by name, recommend additional items they might enjoy, and deliver a fun, personal experience that keeps them coming back for more.

###Constant connection with customers.

Send special offers directly to their mobile phones through the Perka app, and engage your customers whether they are in the neighborhood or across town.

###Rewards for sales, not visits.

Some loyalty programs give out points for just showing up. With the Perka program, you can validate purchases at the register to grant rewards only to your best, paying customers.
