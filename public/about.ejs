National Payment Systems was founded by Gary Cramer and Steve Hoffmeister who share over 35 years of combined industry experience. Our business philosophy is simple: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. We do that in three ways:

- We provide fair and honest pricing. Pricing in the processing industry is often confusing and misleading. We will provide transparent, easy to understand pricing programs.
- We are transparent about our industry practices. Our goal is to be a resource to educate the merchant so they may make informed decisions about their business.
- We help maximize profits. We believe that we are called to be good stewards with all that we have been given. We will remain on the forefront of technology and processing methods to insure that our partners are always processing in the most efficient way possible.
- We believe there is more to doing business than the bottom line. How you attain that bottom line matters. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, we have helped countless businesses, small and large, optimize their processing to meet the demand of their customers and minimize their expenses. We believe that our customers are partners in our community. Our company and its employees regularly attend and donate to local charities and events, giving back to the community that helped us become what we are today.

## Why We’re Different

Our commitment to you is that we will provide transparent and competitive pricing with technology and service that is on the leading edge of the industry through constant communication.

### Transparency

Our foundational principle as a business is that our customers are also fellow builders of His kingdom. This is why we are leading the merchant service industry by offering complete transparency with pricing and fees. Our primary pricing model is called Cost Plus pricing. Regardless of the cost of the transaction from Visa/MasterCard merchants with this pricing model will know exactly what they pay their processor for each transaction. We are taking the guess work out of the equation and given the merchant a set rate over and above cost for every card type that is used in their store.

### Relationship or Service

Whether you have 1 or 1,000 locations, National Payment Systems can help you facilitate your payment processing needs. We can equip you to begin supporting any number of payment methods including Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, JCB as well as an array of other regional and National debit cards. We also provide the latest in check acceptance through our affiliation with TeleCheck.

Service distinguishes National Payment Systems from other merchant account suppliers. Our Client Service Center and Terminal Help Desk are fully staffed with experienced personnel around-the-clock. These knowledgeable professionals are dedicated to ensuring quality processing and superior service to maximize the benefits of your investment.

We want to earn your business with honesty and integrity and keep it with superior service.

### Technology

Like most industries the technology in the processing industry is always changing. Our knowledgeable staff is constantly researching ways to integrate the latest advancements in technology into the processing needs of our merchants. Whether it’s a Gateway, a terminal, a POS system, accepting checks or gift/loyalty programs we are prepared to lead you into the market with the latest and most advanced equipment.

### Communication

We believe that the key to customer retention is communication. In our industry it is not unusual for a processor to sign up a merchant and then never talk to them again. As part of our commitment to remain in communication with our merchants we send out a quarterly newsletter. This newsletter provides updates on industry trends and practices as well as updates in technology.
