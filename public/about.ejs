			<h2>Transparency</h2>
			<p>Our foundational principle as a business is that our customers are also fellow builders of His kingdom. This is why we are leading the merchant service industry by offering complete transparency with pricing and fees. Our primary pricing model is called Cost Plus pricing. Regardless of the cost of the transaction from Visa/MasterCard merchants with this pricing model will know exactly what they pay their processor for each transaction. We are taking the guess work out of the equation and given the merchant a set rate over and above cost for every card type that is used in their store.</p>

			<h2>Communication</h2>
			<p>We believe that the key to customer retention is communication. In our industry it is not unusual for a processor to sign up a merchant and then never talk to them again. As part of our commitment to remain in communication with our merchants we send out a quarterly newsletter. This newsletter provides updates on industry trends and practices as well as updates in technology.</p>
