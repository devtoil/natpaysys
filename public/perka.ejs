<h2>The customer adoration program.

Easy to use, affordable, and as familiar as an old-fashioned punchcard, the Perka solution helps you capture the potential of big-brand loyalty marketing with the personal touch that only a store like yours can offer. Keep your customers happy and bring new ones in the door, without adding to your workday.








    Get right up and running.

From in-store materials to social media support, we make sure you have everything you need to get your customers excited and your rewards program rolling.

    Connect with your customers anytime, anywhere.

Send special offers directly to your customers’ mobile phones over the Perka app, and reach them whether they’re in the neighborhood or across town.

    Share the love and see the results.

The Perka app links customer rewards to real transactions, so you can track how effectively your customers are engaging with your loyalty program and which perks are most popular.

    Reward sales, not visits.

Some loyalty programs give out points for just showing up. With Perka, you can validate purchases at the register to grant rewards only to your best, paying customers.
