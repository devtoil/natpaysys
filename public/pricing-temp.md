Pricing
	Interchange
		Banking rate for processing - fixed cost every processor pays the same
		over 800 interchange rates (get actual facts later from Gary)
		Google: Interchange Rate Visa
			Interchange Rate MasterCard
			Interchange Rate AmEx
	
	Dues and Assessments
		Rates added by Visa & MasterCard
		used to be simple (11 basis point)
		effective Jan 1, 2015
			chanced for debit vs credit etc

	Markup
		
		Types of Pricing
			Tiered
			EBB
			Cost Plus (aka Interchange Plus)
			Flat rate


		Tiered
		---------------
		Qual	1.59 + 10
		MidQual	+ 0.95
		NonQual	+ 1.50
		
		Processors can change the qualification of cards on a whim based on how often a card is used
		
		
		EBB (Enhanced Bill Back)
		-----------------------------
		pay a low rate up front (1.59)
			on the bill the first month thats what you see
		
		reconcile
		the next month the discount rate is settled vs the interchange rate
			the vast majority are (maybe 1.89)
			you are changed for the difference (0.30) - called the bill back
			and then also charged the Enhancement - the profit for the processor
				to hide this charge many processors repeat the charge as their profit (1.59)
		
		
		Square
		---------------------------
		says they approve everyone
			not all industries are profitable
			so they have in their agreement
			after 30-90 days if you are not profitable they close your account
		
		Flat rate
			also uses a 2 tiered system
			
		2.75% rate
			on a regulated debit card
			durbin amendment
			for debit cards issued by a bank with at least 10 billion in assets 
			max interchange rate is 0.05%


		Cost Plus / Interchange Plus
		---------------
		Transparent and upfront about Markup
		with your current pricing model you do not 	
		use an example of 30 basis point and 0 markup for transaction cost
		
		let us come in and analyze your statement







Assumptions:
Monthly Volume: $20,000
Average Ticket: $100
Visa Rewards 2 Interchange: 1.95% and $0.10, this falls into the Non-Qualified rate for tiered pricing
Assessments:  0.13%

With these assumptions the cost for all processors is $2.18.  
IC rate(transaction amount)+Assessments(transaction amount)+transaction fee=total cost
1.95%($100)+0.13%($100)+$0.10=$2.18

Total Rate and Markup for each pricing model
Interchange Plus
Interchange:   1.95%($100) + $0.10 =					  2.05
Assessments:  0.13%($100)=						+0.13
Processor’s Fee:  0.30%($100) + $0.10 = 					+0.40
Total Rate = 								  2.58
Total Cost =								 -2.18
Mark Up =								  0.40

Note:  Remember that Interchange and Assessments are the same for all processors.  With Interchange Plus pricing the Total Rate is simply the cost  of the transaction plus the processor’s fee.  This is the most transparent pricing model available in the industry.  Regardless of the type of card used in this example, the mark up would always be $0.40.

Tiered
Non Qualified Rate:  2.99%($100) + $0.25 =				 3.24
Total Cost = 								-2.18
Mark Up = 								  1.06

Note:  Remember that with tiered pricing the type of card is arbitrarily assigned to the Qualified, Mid-Qualified or Non-Qualified bucket.  This means that one month the Visa Rewards 2 Card could be in the Mid-Qualified bucket and the next month it is in the Non-Qualified bucket.  The processor’s profit is uncertain and dependent upon which card type they choose to place into each bucket. 

Flat Rate
Swiped						
2.75%($100) = 								 2.75	
Total Cost = 								-2.18
Mark Up = 								 0.57					

Keyed
3.50%($100) + $0.15 = 							 3.65
Total Cost = 								-2.18
Mark Up = 								 1.47

Note:  Remember that rates are generally simple or competitive but not both.  In this example the rate seems to be reasonable but let’s assume that the card used is a Regulated Debit Card.  The cost would drop from $2.18 to $0.27.  This would give this processor a $2.48 swiped mark up and a $3.38 keyed mark up.

Enhanced Billback (EBB)
Qualified Rate:  1.59%($100) + $0.25 =					  1.84
Billback: 0.36%($100) = 							+0.36
Enhancement:  1.59%($100) =						+ 1.59
Total Rate = 								  3.79
Total Cost = 								 -2.18
Mark Up = 								  1.61

Note:  This pricing model quotes a low qualified rate that shows up on the monthly statement.  After reconciling the low rate with the actual interchange rate,  the merchants charged the difference with an “enhancement” fee the following month on the same transaction.

Based on the assumptions above your rate over cost per month would be:
Interchange Plus	Tiered		Flat Rate			Enhanced Billback (EBB)
								Swiped		Keyed	

$80					$212		$114		$294	$322


Take the guess work out of processing rates.
There are hundreds of interchange rates that are dependent upon the type of card being used, how it is processed and industry of the merchant.  We used the Visa Rewards 2 card in this example but it could be any card in the market.  With a different card the interchange rate would change but the rates charged by all the models would stay the same except for Interchange Plus.  Regardless of card type, swiped or keyed or industry the mark up with Interchange Plus will always be the same, negotiated fixed rate.
