## Mission Statement

We exist to glorify God by using our talents and gifts to generate revenue to share with churches and other gospel-centered organizations to help spread the gospel to the ends of the earth.

### Why We Do This

We believe that everything that we have been given (our talents, time and resources) belongs to the Lord. They should be leveraged to bring about the furtherance of His kingdom.

### How We Do This

We call upon Christian business owners to partner with us so that we may take a portion of our profits from the relationship and give them back organizations that work to further the Gospel.

### How It Works

Merchants sign with NPS to process credit cards and NPS donates at least 10% of the revenue from that account to organizations that support Gospel-centered ministry.  List of partners below.
